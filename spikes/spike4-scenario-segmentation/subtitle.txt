All right, final item of the Galactic Defiance meeting.

Our plan to take out the Gromfilamite Queen.

Quiet.

We could be in defiance without talking over each other.

Thank you, Corsica.

As it stands, our assassination task force has yet to provide a clear plan.

We provide lots of plans.

Your committee keeps killing them.

Well, it's an assassination committee.

What do you want them to do?

All intelligence indicates that needs to be a surprise, which is why we need to plan it carefully.

Why don't we turn things over to our assassin, Beth Sanchez?

Great, it's an assassination meeting.

Where the hell is the assassin?

Assassinating.

We're still in a meeting.

We've been meeting about it for months.

It's a plan to kill her with old age.

There is no plan.

We still have to approve one.

Do you even look at your defiantly?

Who has the patience for three factor authentication?

The defiance says hello.

Or goodbye?

I mean, I guess the hello meant goodbye anyway, but this guy beat me to it.

Oh my God, who are you?

An assassin?

I mean, I wish.

Kill her.

Time to go.

Oh shit.

Hey, good news, the Queen is dead.

Bad news, I didn't do it.

Worse news, I need a lift.

I can't approve an extraction from an unapproved assassination.

I'll have to call an emergency meeting.

I'm going to die.

Chicken or restaurant?

You beat out Luigi's.

I'm hammering sushi.

What's up?

Story.

Or maybe not that funny.

Are you pitching a Hulu original?

I I kind of went rogue and I'm trapped on a grump on my chip.

Send the coordinates, I'll pick you up.

Really.

Just like that.

Of course, just like that.

You're my daughter.

Probably Jiro.

Lava cake to go.

The lava cake was already ordered.

I can see it from here.

You don't have to explain.

You're thinking it'd be easy to scan the only warm blooded thing on the ship?

We tried that once.

A lot of rats in the walls.

Is that why the ship always has a bee in the window?

Hey, freeze you first.

Walk right into it.

Wow, Beth, you've been staying busy.

Oh shit, it's Rick Sanchez.

My daughter is just as dangerous.

Wait for the gun also shoots a sign.

Yeah, for clarity, so people know it's quicksand and not a brown portal or diarrhea.

But doesn't the sign tip off the enemy?

No, no, no, the other side says ordinary sand.

There she is.

See, there's your classic diarrhea.

Whatever.

Can we go now?

Just portal me to HQ.

Actually, could you portal me like a block away so they don't know your dad drove you?

Sure.

OK.

All in favor of Natalie thumbnailing an emergency rescue budget.

Oh.

You're a prick.

Stop acting embarrassed.

I'm a legend here.

Ohh.

Hey, Began.

Hey, Rick.

Yes.

It's disappointing that the legend doesn't fall far from the tree.

Huh?

That's a weird way to thank her and apologize.

Thank her for what?

A botched assassination?

Whoa, whoa.

I don't botch shit.

I just turned down sloppy seconds.

Yeah.

Their mothership wasn't on red alert for her birthday.

You sure about that?

Red alert for the Queen's Birthday?

That's right.

Her Majesty is 70 days young but still laying eggs.

Banging drones You go girl.

Yes, Queen, no.

I saw that bitches pillow through her face.

A sting trooper did it.

Why didn't they pin it on us?

Translation.

Excuse me dad, stop helping.

This is the opposite of a nepo baby.

This is a human with half my DNA that despises me for the same reasons you bailed on her.

This organization resents and discourages talent.

It's why working here was always beneath me, and it's why none of you are worth eating her shit.

And if you don't start appreciating her, I guarantee you she'll be.

Next out the door.

It was a good rescue, though.

You got me fired only because you blew your chance to quit.

Oh, my God.

Oh, my God.

I really hope I am the clone, because I never asked to be born.

I can't handle watching you host those parasites.

Clone or not, that's still my blood in your veins.

Yeah, I know.

I'm trying to overcome that.

Ouch.

Oh boohoo.

Whatever dropped me off in space.

What are you going to do?

I'm going to get to the bottom of this inside.

Hit on the queen.

I know a guy that knows a guy that knows some bugs.

Look, I got to drop you off somewhere.

It might as well be the filth encrusted apartment of an insect supremacist arms dealer.

Fine.

I thought you were dropping me off.

I gotta make sure it's the right supremacist.

They all look alike.

Well, hey, no mammals allowed.

That's our guy.

Oh, hey, I didn't mean that about mammals.

You're you're clearly a good one.

She is.

She's very interested in insect politics.

Umm, actually, there's no such thing.

Because insects are genetically inclined for organization.

So tell us which insect organized a hit on the queen?

I don't know.

You guys can't approve.

You're not going to let me fall.

Oh God.

Oh Jesus, just going to lie.

All right, all right.

Shit.

It was fantabulous.

The former Royal Dr. Wait, the medical officer?

That's all I know, I swear.

Is it, though?

Dad, he said.

That's all he knew.

I'm a mammal.

I'm disorganized.

I've heard of that doctor though.

Classic disgraced eugenicist troop.

You can get disgraced for eugenics by insects.

I suppose he had a gift.

Did he have an address?

Hi.

Don't be afraid to surrender.

Yeah, You can even join us as an unlikely ally.

I don't know what that is.

I can explain.

Does your bug culture have ghosts?

Has it had any hit movies about busting ghosts successful enough to generate sequels and cartoons, Of course.

While an unlikely ally would be like a ghost that hangs out with the Ghostbusters, that is the most offensive job offer I've ever received.

More offensive than death.

Good luck with that.

Wait, so he's too cool to be a slimer, but he's asthmatic?

That's new. the Super soldier formula, I said.

New, not creatively trailblazing.

Jesus Christ.

I hope killing these things is leveling us up.

It's some kind of souped up fungus.

What should we be wearing?

Masks?

Nah, we're fine.

It's a bug problem.

These little guys don't affect mammals.

Why would they?

It's a highly evolved symbiote.

Its goal is galactic domination.

So why would it want to be hosted by shit flinging monkeys from a planet named after dirt?

Power disease?

Bragging now that fungus is no disease.

It's the cure my species has been wasting away for generations.

We're being led by I am millennials.

Blockbuster Video.

Just tell my daughter why you whacked your own queen.

Her Majesty, you refused to distribute my medicine so I had her killed in secret and replaced with a robot queen who will all of Crumplum One will gather for her birthday and all will receive a gift.

That's not how birthdays work, dipshit.

How about this for a birthday close airlock 7?

You really don't know me, do you?

And you don't know me.

Or the various sizes of bugs.

All Trumpites.

Of the future.

So much for my fucking brick.

Toro.

What was that, rent free in your head?

Shit.

It's dumb.

People saying something meaningless because they learned a new thing Just means you're thinking about something.

Focus, Dad.

The Queen is a spore bomb.

You better call the Defiance.

Why?

So they can form a committee.

You don't want your old job back?

No, Dad, the defiance sucks, but that doctor keeps trying to kill me.

He is not getting the W.

Oh God.

I'm turning into my father.

That's all you had to say, partner.

All right.

Should be pretty easy.

We get in undetected, find the spore bomb and portal it out of there.

Step one, we blend in as bugs.

Working for the Department of Transportation.

My guy, Cisco will be at the back door at 7:00 AM.

Cisco, my inside man, don't worry.

OK, but what if he doesn't show up?

What's that supposed to mean?

You don't even know Cisco, which is very concerning since this plan seems very dependent on him.

So let me finish the plan.

Cisco provides us with security credentials for the maintenance tunnels and if he doesn't show, what's our backup plan?

I use Cisco so that I don't need a backup plan.

What's that?

We ordered food, remember?

I've never heard of this Cisco guy in my life, but all of a sudden he's the most.

Reliable person ever born, Baby, I work with more reliable people than you.

Make sure my fries are there.

Thank you.

Oh, wait.

Are there fries?

Oh, OK, I see them.

Thank you.

Where were we?

Step three.

We quickly and quietly patch into the surveillance grid.

Wait, how'd we get there?

With the credentials we got from Cisco.

So in other words, if Cisco has never not shown up, can I just ask, what does someone have to do to achieve the level of trust you place in this random man?

I trust plenty of people.

Name 2 Easy Bird.

And Cisco's at the same level as bird person.

Yeah, he listens to my plan.

Like, yes, I would too if I was the pivotal goddamn participant.

That's all this is.

You're jealous of Cisco to rely on him?

If he doesn't show up at 7:00, we're two humans in bug costumes banging on a door until the cops find us.

Then we're running and gunning.

We're not going to be running or gunning at any point in this plan.

It's going to be you, me and Cisco staying under the radar and preventing a coronation catastrophe.

Oh shit, free.

I don't know what got into Cisco.

This may be unpopular, but the Queen was a bitch.

I mean big deal.

You had a billion kids.

Did you find them?

We're kind of hard to miss.

Stay back or die.

She's infected.

She would have turned.

I think I normally look like this.

I mean, maybe.

I don't know you.

I need your labs, your data, everything you've got on this thing.

Stop pointing your gun at me.

Stop pointing a gun at me.

Can you cover your mouth?

So it's true you're infected.

It obviously effects mammals slower, but yeah, it's jump species.

And then perhaps in you lies the cure.

Was stepping from the shadows meant to give that more weight?

No, my pen rolled into the corner.

But even if you do cure it, our scanners show a big, scary, dramatic spore hive growing deep underground.

Real, you know, final boss vibes.

They're building an ultra army.

Kind of what I just said, but looks like we.

Both need an antidote so tenuous alliance, unlikely allies.

Dad, am I growing a horn?

Yeah.

Just relax.

I'm working on it.

I can feel them.

I've kind of funny, huh?

I hate working with others.

But now the collective is calling.

Baby.

Send that shit to voicemail, sweetie.

I. Cadets, for your service, the Federation stands strong and strong with you.

Yes.

Thought that would be it.

Don't sweat it, we're long on bugs and short on ethics.

I mean, if I got to be fascist.

Oh shit, what the hell?

No, sorry, sorry.

I brought in my rotating math projector line.

Put it back in your decoration bin.

Holy shit you did it.

The projector helped.

Wait, does this mean my family won't get paid?

I told them my death would pay for college.

Oh, you'll die.

You all die eventually.

Look, I know it might suck to be my daughter sometimes, but there are some perks to being related.

All right, I'm still human.

I like boobs.

I like boob milk.

Oh, no, I like Jelly.

I want your Christmas Jelly.

I want boob milk.

I like boobs.

What?

Never mind, I'll do it.

I'm cured, baby.

Cured human.

Oh shit.

Sorry dad.

He's coming.

Small attack squad, you killed a lot of us.

Well, who else would be down for this?

I mean it is bring your daughter to work day.

Bring your daughter to work day.

It's my work.

Dad.

You were sitting on that one for the last six hours.

Thank you, Rick.

It is rare to find something bird daughter likes.

Boys.

These puppies have triple spore filters.

Should keep us fungus free.

It's time to deliver the payload.

Is the payload a bomb or a cure?

Who cares?

It's a payload.

I think it's time we remove Gene from the text thread.

You can't respond.

It only feeds the beast.

Speaking of beasts, I see you are parenting as well.

Oh, she called me.

I'm trying not to blow it.

You and me both.

This way.

You let us into a trap.

What's trap?

Didn't you want to die?

Yes, I'm going to be dead.

So I'll make an effort to check on that guy's kid in college.

Oh look at that, I think she is having a good time.

Don't start celebrating yet.

She gets it from her mother.

Glad you picked up my call, Dad.

Glad you called.

We don't have to do it all the time.

This fucking guy.

Yes it's me again.

I warned you I had different sized bugs.

That was foreshadowing.

Every hive needs a mind and in those minds will be me paying no rent at all.

I might even charge rents quite a birthday.

No, this guys brain is cooked.

Moving fast.

Smash.

You could cut all the.

Heads off you like you'll never be rid of me.

Stop laughing you idiot.

Ohh shit, put me back on.

Put me back on top.

With me, I did everything you could do with it.

So can I kill these guys?

Is the truce over?

I don't know, Is it?

Perhaps we Grumplomites can change without having to transform into giant monsters?

I'm sure the Defiance would be interested in that.

Get a room.

Ha ha, I had fun.

Today, I am proud to honor heroes from both sides on what will forever mark the dawn of a new age.

Now that we're going to be doing this every week, I mean, hopefully never again, actually.

Congratulations.

The Defiance owes you to a debt of gratitude.

Rick.

Pretty cool to see you working with your daughter.

Pretty hot.

Oh, OK.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Please don't fuck my coworkers.

Hey, you called me.

Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

Oh, shit.

Cisco.

What's wrong, baby?

Remember the space guy who paid me all that money to do that thing?

Well, I missed the goddamn thing.

The space guy know you had a drug problem.

I didn't before I met you, Sandy.

Oh, sorry.

I shouldn't blame you.

It's OK.

More drugs.

Yes, please.

Did you get any of that?

Neutral dressing.

For multi and institution we want the.

Dementia.

I. Sayonara.

But there's no hail on the Hibi.

To be seen way.

You should.

Not.

He should push in on YouTube.

Touching Joshua the Deep.

Function.

Neutral.

Show I'm being sure that each.

I.

I. I better accuse you.

Shadow us.
